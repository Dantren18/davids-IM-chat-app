# Davids IM App

You can view the hosted version of this app here https://davids-im-chat-app-upqm.vercel.app/

## Information

This web app was created using React and 'react-chat-engine'. react-chat-engine is a chat API that serves as the backend of the project

## Features

Users can sign in with their account, then create message groups with other users, and send text or images. Users are informed when their message has been read by the other user

## Log in Details

To log in and try out the app, you can use the username 'david' and the password '123123'

### Future Updates

A feature I want to add next is the ability to create an account on the website.

## Run Locally

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
